/**
 * Generate the Ed25519 keypair an agent signs its AgentCard with.
 *
 * The private half becomes the `A2A_SIGNING_KEY` secret; the public half is
 * served at the agent's JWKS path and pinned by the gateway on first
 * registration (Trust-On-First-Use). No secret is shared in either direction —
 * see `src/a2a/verify.ts` for the other half of the contract.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-keys.mjs              # print the private JWK
 *   node scripts/generate-keys.mjs --kid my-key # choose the key id
 *
 * The `kid` is required, not decorative: it goes in the JWS protected header and
 * is what a gateway pins, so `parsePrivateJwk` refuses a key without one. Rotate
 * by generating a new key with a *new* kid and serving both public keys until
 * every gateway has re-fetched.
